Learning how to work with unity through courses - creating a solar system

## About
This is just a simple experimental project created in unity for my own learning purposes.
All C# scripts, as well as textures and some other assets are without modification used from course ​Game Design and Development 1: 2D Shooter​ by Brian Winn​.

I've tried to roughly recreate correct ratios of objects and distances etc but ended up with:
1 - sizes are in approximate ratios based on Sun being 10m
2 - distances are in approximate ratios with max distance of Neptune being 50m from the center of Sun
3 - Pluto is not a planet, sorry King FlippyNips
4 - Satellite and Earth moon scales are just random numbers, that's for the "show"
5 - Main Camera is just a bit further than Uranus and Neptune goes behind so we can see something and even hear Uranus sound playing.
